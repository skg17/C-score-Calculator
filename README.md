# C-Score Calculator
A C-Score calculator for Third Year Physics students (graduating in 2023).

***Couple of things to note:***
- Some modules are missing, namely: 'Galactic Dynamics & Interstellar Medium' and 'Relativistic High Energy Astrophysics'. If you are taking one of these modules, just select another module when prompted, since all modules have the same credit value.
- This program should work for people taking on extra credits, but there is a chance something whacky might happen. But then again, if you take on extra credits for fun you will probably enjoy calculating your C-score manually.
- Credit values are all counted as 15, regardless of whether the module was passed or not. If you failed a module, bear in mind that the calculated C-score will probably not reflect your final one unless you have a condoned fail.

***How to use:***
Make sure you have Python3 installed, and just run the .py file, following the instructions when prompted.
